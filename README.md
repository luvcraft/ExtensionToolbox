# ExtensionToolbox
A handy toolbox of extension methods for Unity projects
## Implementation
There are four ways to implement this toolbox:
### Method 1:
In the Unity Editor, open Package Manager (`Window > Package Manager`),\
click on the "`+`" in the top left, and choose `Add package from git URL`,\
and then enter `https://github.com/luvcraft/ExtensionToolbox.git`.
### Method 2:
Paste the following line into the `"dependencies"` section of your project's `Packages/manifest.json` file:\
`    "com.studiohunty.extensiontoolbox": "https://github.com/luvcraft/ExtensionToolbox.git",`
### Method 3:
Add this project as a **submodule** of your project, in `Assets/ExtensionToolbox`
### Method 4:
Just copy `ExtensionMethods.cs` from this repo into your project.
